                <h2>The Strongest Maratha King</h2>

                <p><strong>Shivajiraje Shahajiraje Bhosale</strong> was an Indian ruler. He was born on 19th February
                    1630 on Fort Shivneri. Shivaji Maharaj carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining
                    Adilshahi Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of Maratha Empire.
                    In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.
                    Shivaji Maharaj's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing
                    and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji Maharaj established a competent
                    and progressive civil administration with well-structured administrative institutions.
